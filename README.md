# Todoapp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

This is a basic todo app I built while learning angular which adds task to tasklist and deletes task.

It uses localstorage to store the task information.

The projects makes used of services and dependency injection, http calls etc.

A complete package to start with..
